    <h3>Follow following steps to modify existing apps or to create new ones</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/ectechno/seranet.apps" target="_blank">Seranet.apps Github repository</a> on to your own GitHub account</li>
        <li>Clone it to your local dev environment and open Seranet.Apps project with VisualStudio (or any other editor)</li>
        <li>This is a pure html/JS application with no server code, therefore you may use any text editor instead of VS</li>
        <li>Every applet you see in 'Explore' is a self contained plugin located in app/module/pluginModule folder</li>
        <li>To create a new applet, you can copy and paste a existing plugin and do modifications accordingly</li>
        <li>For simple apps with just a link + image, the changes you ned to make are trivial, just read the plugin code you will know</li>
        <li>You can run the project and test it, through any simple HTTP server (or directly on VisualStudio)</li>
        <li>Once done, commit/push the changes to your Github repository, then make a pull request to the 'ectechno' original </li>
        <li>Someone will review your changes and deploy to the production soon :) !!!</li>
    </ul>
